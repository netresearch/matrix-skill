# Matrix Skill

An Agentic Skill for Matrix chat communication, distributed as a Claude Code plugin.

## Overview

This skill enables AI coding agents to send messages to Matrix chat rooms on behalf of users. Messages are sent using the user's own access token, so they appear as coming from the user. Works with any Matrix homeserver.

**What is an Agentic Skill?** Platform-agnostic instructions and tools that AI coding agents can use. This skill is packaged as a Claude Code plugin but follows the open [Agentic Skills specification](https://github.com/anthropics/agentic-skills).

## Features

- **Send messages** to any joined Matrix room
- **Rich formatting** - bold, italic, code, strikethrough, spoilers, lists, blockquotes
- **Smart link shortening** - Jira, GitHub, GitLab URLs become readable links
- **Matrix mentions** - `@user:server` becomes clickable user pill
- **Room links** - `#room:server` becomes clickable room link
- **Code blocks** - Syntax-highlighted multi-line code
- **List rooms** to find the right destination
- **Read messages** (unencrypted messages only in v1)

## Prerequisites
